# _s-custom-menus
This GitHub repository has the files necessary to add basic show/hide functionality for navigation sub menus in the _s WordPress starter theme.

If you want your parent link to still be clickable but not all of the sub menu items to be visible on mobile screen sizes, this will address that for you.

Open custom-php-code.php to begin.
